# Nord Theme

This is a [nord](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord) theme for
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

You can copy this theme into your vault/.obsidian/themes to apply it.

It differs slightly from insanum's theme by steadily decreasing the font weight of each subsequently sized header to give a more distinct appearance to nested headers. It also decreases the size of math formulas.
